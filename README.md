Factory Idle style game, that doesn't yet have a name. Combine basic resources to get more advanced resources, and climb up the tech ladder.

By the way, there's a running version of the game on my web space: http://bookalong.x10host.com/idlegame/  Enjoy!

Currently built is up to producing 3 flint tools: shovel, pickaxe and axe.  Once you build your first flint pickaxe, stone blocks will
unlock.

These are visible but haven't been coded yet:
stone (requires flint pickaxe at minimum to mine)
stone block
stone furnace (made from stone blocks, allows using wood to cook items)
logs (requires flint axe)
firewood (used in furnace and later things)

Additional planned elements
copper ore filter (gathered from stone)
copper ingot (made in furnace)
copper hammer (used for crafting many other things)
copper shovel, pickaxe, axe
copper bucket
crude copper pipe (barely suitable for steam)
copper boiler
